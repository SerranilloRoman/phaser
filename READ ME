The first thing was reading the "Getting started" guide on the phaser website and then read the "making your first game" guide
I already had xampp so there was no problem with that part
After that I copied the code into mi index.html as well as the assets.

Whit the set up made I started messing around with the code that I had, the majority of the results where a lot of errors even thought the game was runing.

I tried and tried and tried to make a moving platform but the code example gived at the phaser page didn't work for me, I tried the tween animation example, didn't work as well and none of the rest of the tutorial were useful enough
after I gave up on the moving platform I tried, succesfully this time, to add music I added the "american patrol" song since the phaser guy reminded me of the circus clown of the game circus for the NES
then following the american theme I changed the sprites, I made the dude spritesheet to make him look more american, specifically giving him kind of an "Uncle Sam" look.
I changed th bomb main cause of our phaser guy demise for the URSS emblem and the stars changed to oil barrels for obvius reasons, being hit with the urss "bombs" makes you a commrade.

In order to do all that I needed some instructions on audio managaement (I used a great video i found: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKeTMMmAbfQ&ab_channel=gammafp) that I think was the most useful thing.

The only thing I could not solve was an issue with the audio not being posible to reproduce right at the start because of some google politics on media.
